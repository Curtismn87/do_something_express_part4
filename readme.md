# Do Something Part 3

For tonight's homework, you'll be replacing the hard-coded to-do objects
with Sequelize models.

Please:

- Create a database folder inside app
  - create a config.js file which connects to the DB. 
- Create Sequelize models for both list and task
- Convert the rest of your application to reference these models.
