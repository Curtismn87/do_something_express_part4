# Do Something Part 4

For tonight's homework, you will add AJAX to your front end to handle each of the requests. i.e. converting
this application to a single page application

### Try starting small:

- When the user clicks a delete button,
  - submit a `delete` request to remove a list
  - hide that element if the AJAX request responds successfully.

### And then:

- Implement each of the CRUD actions using AJAX only.

### And finally:


- use `history.pushState` or `window.location.hash` to update the URL to reflect the "state of the application"
