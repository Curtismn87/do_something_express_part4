# Do Something Part 3

For tonight's homework, you'll be replacing the hard-coded List and Task objects
with Sequelize models.

Please:

- Create a connection.js file which connects to the DB. 
- Create Sequelize models for both Lists and Tasks.
- Update the rest of your application to reference these models.

By the end, you should be able to use Postman, Cocoa, or plain old AJAX to perform all CRUD functions on both Lists and Tasks.

Don't worry about the view for now!
