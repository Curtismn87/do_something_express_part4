# Do Something Part 4

For tonight's homework, you will add AJAX to your front end to handle request. i.e. You'll convert
this application to a single-page application!

### Checkpoint 1:

Make a view that shows all of the lists (using front-end Javascript, not Handlebars).

### Checkpoint 2:

Add "Delete" functionality to the lists such that when a user clicks a "delete" button, the app will...
- ...submit a `delete` request to remove a list
- ...hide that element if the AJAX request responds successfully.

### Checkpoint 3:

Show the tasks. Bonus points if you show them with the appropriate list!

### Checkpoint 4:

Add "Delete" functionality to the tasks.

### Checkpoint 5:

Add the other CRUD actions (C and U) to both models.

### And finally:

Use `history.pushState` or `window.location.hash` to update the URL to reflect the "state of the application".
